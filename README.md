# VA-Tool
Some vulnerability assessment tools at one place.

A Vulnerability Assessment tool written in bash with a focus on reliability and simplicity. Designed to be used in combination with other tools for attack surface discovery in bug bounties and pentests.

The tool written in bash that allows you to run some other VA tools on the target server. It is a really simple tool that does run some of the other tools automatically by taking the input from the end user.
